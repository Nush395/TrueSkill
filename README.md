# TrueSkill

This is a library I created as part of my several weeks journey in understanding the TrueSkill algorithm and 
also to implement something that I could use to rate table football matches.

Resources I've used to help me on my way:
* https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/NIPS2006_0688.pdf - the original paper
 *https://www.moserware.com/assets/computing-your-skill/The%20Math%20Behind%20TrueSkill.pdf - useful article giving a bit more detail

For my explanation of some of the algorithms in here please see: TBD.....

Other implementations I found:
* https://github.com/sublee/trueskill (Python)
* https://github.com/moserware/Skills (C#)
