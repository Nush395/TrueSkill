# TrueSkill
A library that implements part of the Microsoft TrueSkill algorithm to rate table football games. Specifically this library currently implements the two player/two team case.
## Motivation
I created this library as a fun way of being able to understand the TrueSkill algorithm as part of my journey on all things Bayesian and Machine Learning.
## Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* Scipy 1.1.0
## Usage
TBD...
## Credits
As listed above the [original paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/NIPS2006_0688.pdf) where the details of the TrueSkill algorithm were laid out. 
I used the following blog/article to help with my understanding and it was very useful

### Further explanation
Please see my blog post here (TBD) for more details on the implementation

### Other implementations:
Below are listed some other implementations I found that implement the general TrueSkill algorithm very nicely.
